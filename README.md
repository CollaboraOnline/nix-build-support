# Collabora Online nix-build-support

This repository contains community-supported nix build support for
developing Collabora Online. We do not support, and recommend you do not
use, this in a production environment

# General usage

The following I know to work
- building Core and Collabora Online for Android on NixOS
- building Core and Collabora Online on NixOS
- running Core and Collabora Online on NixOS

You likely want to use this with [Nilla's cli](https://github.com/nilla-nix/cli)
as, while you can manually use the shells, it will provide a much more
sugared experience. You can follow [Nilla's quickstart guide](https://nilla.dev/guides/quickstart/)
to install it

You will probably want to keep this directory *alongside* your nix
rather than cloning into it. That's because nilla *will copy everything
to your store if you use it to enter a shell, leading to a very long
delay*. LibreOffice translations/etc. are gigabytes big in a full clone.
You do not want that.

# Language Server support

We've included `clangd` (by way of `pkgs.clang-tools`) in the `core` projects so
you can use it as a language server in your editor of choice.

Many editors come with ways to set this up
- `helix` has support by default
- `vim`/`neovim` - with [`vim-lsp`](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp)/[`vim.lsp`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html)/etc.
- `emacs` with [`lsp-mode`](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-clangd/)
- `vscode` with [the `clangd` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd)

To properly use this, you'll need to generate a compilation database, which you
can do with

```bash
make vim-ide-integration
# See https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Vim for the source of this
```

don't worry if you're using an editor other than vim - the compilation database
generated by this command is usable wherevere the language server is supported!

# Usage with direnv

The .envrc.template assumes that you have kept this directory alongside
your rather than cloning libreoffice into it, and further that the
folder you have is called 'nilla'. To do that, you'll need to clone this
repository with the following

    git clone git@github.com:CollaboraOnline/nix-build-support nilla

The .envrc.template also assumes you have some nested directory
structure, such as

    - nilla/
    - android/
      - core/
      - online/
    - standard/
      - core/
      - online/

and are placing it in your clone directories (here 'core' and 'online')

This is a reasonable assumption as you will need separate shells for
core and online, so you can't just place the .envrc directly above your
clone of this repository.

If you decide to change either of these assumptions, the path should be
trivial to modify. You'll need to change the envrc anyway to fill in the
shell name you want. Again, this should be fairly self explanatory
